# Extracting-Linguistic-Information-from-LLMs

## Introduction
This repository contains datasets designed for studying 
linguistic knowledge and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs), focusing on their morphosyntactic competence
The data is organized into two main categories:



## Tasks Overview

**Syntax (Task 1)**  
Syntax (referred to as Task 1 in the paper): Involves labeling syntactic information at the sentence level, specifically identifying subjects, objects, and indirect objects.

**Derivation**  
Derivation â€“ Focuses on the morphological decomposition of derivational words, with two task variants:

- **Task 2**: Conducted across five languages, involving the identification of morpheme boundaries and the labeling of each morpheme.  
- **Task 3**: An in-depth study of morphological decomposition, focusing specifically on German and Amharic.


Each dataset folder includes standard splits: **train**, **dev**, and **test**.
